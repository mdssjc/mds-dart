# DART PATTERNS RECORDS

Dart 3 introduces patterns to the language, a major new category of grammar. Beyond this new way to write Dart code, there are several other language enhancements, including

- records for bundling data of different types,
- class modifiers for controlling access, and
- new switch expressions and if-case statements.

These features expand the choices you have when writing Dart code. In this codelab, you learn how to use them to make your code more compact, streamlined, and flexible.
